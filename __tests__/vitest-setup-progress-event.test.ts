/**
 * Regression test for the `ReferenceError: ProgressEvent is not defined`
 * unhandled rejection that intermittently failed whole CI runs
 * (all tests green, exit code 1).
 *
 * MSW's XMLHttpRequest interceptor evaluates the bare `ProgressEvent`
 * identifier inside async response callbacks. Vitest's jsdom teardown does
 * `keys.forEach((key) => delete global[key])`, so any *own* property named
 * `ProgressEvent` — jsdom's, or a polyfill a setup file installed — is gone
 * once the environment for a test file is torn down. A callback that settles
 * after that point then throws.
 *
 * `vitest.setup.ts` therefore keeps a fallback on `globalThis`'s prototype
 * chain, which `delete` cannot reach. This test performs exactly the deletion
 * teardown performs and asserts the identifier still resolves.
