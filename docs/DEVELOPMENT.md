# Development

This document is for contributors working on `agent-canvas` itself.

## Recommended local workflow

`npm run dev` runs the full local stack (agent-server + automation backend via
`uvx`, Vite dev server with live reload, and an ingress proxy) — all without
Docker.

## Repository boundaries

This repository contains the Agent Canvas frontend and local-stack orchestration. Use the sibling repositories for their owned layers:

- [`OpenHands/software-agent-sdk`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk) owns the Python SDK, Agent Server, agent/tool behavior, conversations, workspaces, events, and server API.
- [`OpenHands/typescript-client`](https://github.com/OpenHands/typescript-client) owns browser-compatible typed access to that Agent Server API. Add client methods there rather than reimplementing API calls in Canvas.
- [`OpenHands/extensions`](https://github.com/OpenHands/extensions) owns reusable skills, plugins, automations, and integrations; [`OpenHands/automation`](https://github.com/OpenHands/automation) owns automation definitions, scheduling, webhooks, run history, and dispatching; Agent Server/SDK code executes the dispatched conversations.

When a feature crosses repositories, implement the backend contract in the SDK first, expose it through `typescript-client`, and consume it in Canvas. Coordinate automation lifecycle changes in `automation`. See the repository [contributor notes](../AGENTS.md) and follow the [custom code-review guide](../.agents/skills/custom-codereview-guide.md) for every pull request.


For a static frontend build (better for slow networks, remote access, tunnels):

```sh
npm run dev:static
```

The published `agent-canvas` binary also supports partial-stack modes when you want to run the frontend and backend processes separately:

```sh
agent-canvas --frontend-only
agent-canvas --backend-only
```

Both modes still start the ingress proxy; the proxy only routes to the services started by that mode.

The dev stack uses `uvx` to run a temporary `agent-server`
installation on `127.0.0.1:18000` and points the frontend at it. It isolates
conversation persistence by setting separate `OH_CONVERSATIONS_PATH`,
`OH_BASH_EVENTS_DIR`, and `OH_VSCODE_PORT` values under `.openhands-dev/`, and
keeps its tmux sockets under `~/.openhands/agent-canvas/tmux` (via
`TMUX_TMPDIR`), so it does not collide with other local or cloud-backed
OpenHands sessions. If `$HOME` is on a filesystem that does not support Unix
domain sockets (some devcontainers, NFS/CIFS homes), set the standard
`TMUX_TMPDIR` env var to a local path such as `/tmp` and the dev stack will use
it instead.

### Environment Variables

| Variable                  | Description                    | Default |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- |
| `PORT`                    | Ingress port                   | `8000`  |
| `OH_AUTOMATION_GIT_REF`   | Git ref for automation backend (overrides the pinned default version) | *(unset)* |
| `OH_AGENT_SERVER_GIT_REF` | Git ref for agent-server (overrides the pinned default version) | *(unset)* |

### Alternative: Minimal Mode (without Automation)

To run without the automation service:

```sh
npm run dev:minimal
```

This runs only agent-server + Vite (no automation backend or ingress).
Access at `http://localhost:3001/`

### Agent server version selection

By default, the latest released version from PyPI is used. You can override this (highest precedence first):

```sh
# Run against a local software-agent-sdk checkout.
OH_AGENT_SERVER_LOCAL_PATH=/abs/path/to/software-agent-sdk npm run dev

# Use a git branch or commit (takes precedence over version)
OH_AGENT_SERVER_GIT_REF=main npm run dev
OH_AGENT_SERVER_GIT_REF=abc1234 npm run dev

# Use a specific PyPI version
OH_AGENT_SERVER_VERSION=1.18.0 npm run dev
```

`OH_AGENT_SERVER_LOCAL_PATH` must be an absolute path to a `software-agent-sdk` checkout containing the `openhands-agent-server`, `openhands-sdk`, `openhands-tools`, and `openhands-workspace` workspace packages. The agent-server itself is rebuilt from local source on each start (`uvx --reinstall`); the other workspace packages are installed editable, so their source changes take effect without a rebuild.

### Other useful overrides

- `OH_CANVAS_SAFE_BACKEND_PORT` — backend port for the isolated server (default `18000`)
- `OH_CANVAS_SAFE_VSCODE_PORT` — VS Code sidecar port (default `backend port + 1`)
- `OH_CANVAS_SAFE_STATE_DIR` — base directory for isolated server state
- `VITE_WORKING_DIR` — repo root used for new conversations (defaults to the current checkout)

## Alternative development workflows

### Multiple local backends (shared persistence)

To run a second standalone agent-server alongside `npm run dev` while sharing
its conversation history and encrypted secrets, you can use the
`npm run dev:extra-backend` helper. It launches an extra server on `:18002` that
reuses the bundled instance's state dir.

### Frontend against an existing backend

Use this only if you intentionally started `agent-server` yourself or want the frontend to talk to another backend:

```sh
npm run dev:frontend
```

The frontend-only workflow expects the backend at `127.0.0.1:8000` by default.

If you set `LOCAL_BACKEND_API_KEY`, it is used as the API key for the agent-server (mapped internally to `OH_SESSION_API_KEYS_0`). The launcher auto-generates and persists a key when `LOCAL_BACKEND_API_KEY` is not set.

### Mock mode

If you want to run the frontend without a live backend, use:

```sh
npm run dev:mock
```

## Build and test

```sh
npm run test
npm run build
npm run start
```

Useful targeted verification for the isolated dev launcher:

```sh
npm run test -- __tests__/api/agent-server-config.test.ts __tests__/scripts/dev-safe.test.ts
```

### Mutation testing

Stryker checks whether the Vitest suite detects deliberate changes to the
first-party TypeScript source under `src/`. The default configuration excludes
tests, declarations, generated files, fixtures, mocks, and development seeds.

```sh
# Full mutation run (expensive for the whole frontend)
npm run test:mutation

# Reuse results from the previous run
npm run test:mutation:incremental

# Mutate only production files changed from the local main branch
npm run test:mutation:diff

# Compare with another base ref, such as the latest remote main
npm run test:mutation:diff -- origin/main
```

The HTML report is written to `reports/mutation.html`. Mutation scores are
report-only initially; establish a stable baseline before adding a failing
threshold.

Stryker does not cover the small Python surface in this repository; mutating it
would need a Python test harness and Python-specific mutation tool.

## CSS isolation and host-app customization

The standalone app and the exported provider/root wrapper now scope all bundled CSS under a dedicated shell element with the `data-agent-server-ui` attribute. That means Tailwind utilities, HeroUI component styles, xterm styles, and local CSS only apply inside the OpenHands UI subtree instead of leaking into a host app.

### Embedding strategy

- Use `AgentServerUIProviders` in host apps. It renders a scoped style root by default.
- For direct wrapper control, use `AgentServerUIRoot`.
- The standalone app opts out of the provider wrapper because the router layout already renders the scoped root.

### Customization strategy

Theme and surface tokens are exposed as CSS custom properties on the scoped root. You can override them either through the provider/root `styleOverrides` prop or with host CSS targeting `[data-agent-server-ui]`.

```tsx
<AgentServerUIProviders
  styleOverrides={{
    "--oh-color-base": "#101820",
    "--oh-color-content-2": "#f5f7ff",
    "--oh-accent": "#8b5cf6",
  }}
>
  <App />
</AgentServerUIProviders>
```

If you want Tailwind layout utilities on the inner themed container, pass `contentClassName` instead of `className`, because the outer scope element is what all generated selectors key off of.

## Environment variables

You can create a `.env` file in the project directory with these variables based on `.env.sample`.
