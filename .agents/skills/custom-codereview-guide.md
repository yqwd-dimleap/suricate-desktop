# OpenHands Agent Canvas Code Review Guidelines

This guide supplements the public `code-review` skill with rules specific to
`OpenHands/OpenHands`, the Agent Canvas frontend. Read `AGENTS.md` first; it is
the detailed source of truth for current architecture and test conventions.

Be direct and constructive. Review correctness and architecture, not formatting
that lint or the compiler already checks.

## Review Decision

- Submit exactly one review: **APPROVE** or **COMMENT**. Never use
  **REQUEST_CHANGES**.
- Default to **APPROVE** when there are no important findings. Nitpicks and
  optional cleanup are not reasons to withhold approval.
- Use **COMMENT** for correctness, security, architecture, missing evidence, or
  unmet acceptance criteria. Let a human maintainer make the blocking decision.
- Do not approve changes that can affect agent or benchmark behavior—prompts,
  tool selection, conversation payloads, terminal behavior, planning, memory,
  or evaluation paths—without human review and appropriate lightweight evals.
- Read the linked issue and include a compact checklist covering each acceptance
  criterion. Meeting the checklist is necessary but does not replace review for
  regressions, security, or maintainability.

## Repository Ownership

Put behavior in the repository that owns it:

| Repository                     | Owns                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OpenHands/OpenHands`          | Agent Canvas UI, frontend state, backend selection, frontend service integration, and local-stack orchestration |
| `OpenHands/software-agent-sdk` | Agent Server, agents, tools, conversations, events, workspaces, and the canonical server API                    |
| `OpenHands/typescript-client`  | Browser-compatible typed access to the Agent Server API                                                         |
| `OpenHands/extensions`         | Reusable skills, plugins, and integrations                                                                      |
| `OpenHands/automation`         | Scheduling, webhooks, run history, and automation dispatch                                                      |

The normal dependency direction is Agent Server contract → TypeScript client →
Canvas. Flag raw endpoint reimplementations, Canvas-local copies of server
contracts, and changes opened in the wrong repository.

## Architecture That Guides Agents

Agents tend to copy the nearest pattern and choose the shortest compiling path.
Review the codebase as part of the product surface that guides those choices:

1. **Make the conventional path cheapest.** New work should naturally reuse a
   named hook, service, store, or feature module instead of adding another branch
   to a shared root.
2. **Fail forbidden dependencies mechanically.** Repeated review guidance should
   become a lint rule, compiler boundary, or architecture test. Do not grow this
   document when a small executable guard would be clearer.
3. **Give durable state one obvious writer.** A backend setting, consent value,
   conversation cache entry, or persisted browser value should have one named
   owner. Flag second writers and component-local mirrors of authoritative state.
4. **Prefer owned feature files over shared switches.** Product work should
   usually extend a feature-owned module. Shared registries and root conditionals
   need a concrete reason.
5. **Keep exceptions narrow and visible.** Exceptions belong in a small allowlist
   next to the guard that enforces the rule and should be reviewed as architecture
   changes.

Treat “deep module” as a design heuristic, not a line-count target. A good module
has a narrow, stable interface and hides cohesive complexity. Do not split a file
merely because it is long, and do not create layers that only rename or forward
arguments. Prefer a small pure seam when it removes duplicated decisions, makes
ownership explicit, or enables focused tests.

### React effects

`useEffect` is for synchronizing React with an external system. Flag effects used
to:

- derive render data from props or state;
- respond to a user action that can run in the event handler;
- initialize a value that belongs in a lazy state initializer;
- mirror one store or cache into another component state value; or
- repair ordering created by competing writers.

An effect is not automatically wrong. Subscription, browser API, timer, and
network synchronization still belong in effects when cleanup and dependency
semantics are explicit.

## Blocking Architecture Checkpoints

### Agent Server and Cloud API access

`src/api/no-direct-agent-server-calls.test.ts` is the executable source of truth.
Do not approve new raw `fetch`, `axios`, shared `openHands`, or low-level HTTP
client access to Agent Server endpoints. Use `@openhands/typescript-client` with
the options from `src/api/agent-server-client-options.ts`.

Cloud and runtime-sandbox requests must go through `callCloudProxy`; runtime
requests must provide the correct `hostOverride` and authentication mode. Review
changes to the guard's allowlist as architecture changes. Do not copy its current
entries into this guide—the test should remain the one authoritative list.

### Event wire contracts

The SDK event model is the wire authority, the TypeScript client mirrors it, and
Canvas consumes the published client type. Do not approve Canvas-local
redeclarations, partial intersections, module augmentation, or presentation
fields added to wire-event interfaces.

A contract change should land in this order:

1. SDK model/schema and serialization coverage.
2. TypeScript-client mirror derived from the SDK payload.
3. Published client release.
4. Canvas consumption and rendering/telemetry coverage.

Canvas-only presentation state belongs in a separate view model keyed by event
identity.

### Telemetry and durable frontend state

- `src/services/telemetry.ts` is the only owner of the Canvas PostHog client.
- React events go through typed functions in `src/hooks/use-tracking.ts`; components
  must not call PostHog directly.
- Consent rendering uses the telemetry consent external store, not mirrored local
  state. `setTelemetryConsent` remains the single consent controller.
- A business milestone has one canonical capture. Flag duplicate conditional
  captures.
- For other durable values, prefer the existing named service/store/hook and flag
  new storage writes from arbitrary components.

## Dependencies and Releases

- Direct dependencies are exact-pinned. Keep `package.json` and
  `package-lock.json` synchronized through npm; do not hand-edit one side only.
- Treat changes to dependency exemptions, git pins, and security overrides as
  reviewable policy changes. `__tests__/package-library.test.ts` is the executable
  source of truth for allowed specs.
- Scrutinize newly published third-party dependency versions for supply-chain
  risk. First-party OpenHands packages are exempt from a waiting period but not
  from contract and release-order review.
- Package version changes belong in explicit release PRs and must match the
  release workflow expectations.

## Testing and Evidence

- Require evidence proportional to the behavior changed. For UI behavior, use a
  screenshot or video from the real app. For CLI, API, or scripts, require the
  exact runtime command and observed result.
- Runtime and user-visible bug fixes require before-and-after evidence through
  the real production-facing path. The before evidence must reproduce the bug on
  the base branch or released version; the after evidence must repeat the same
  setup on the PR head and show the corrected behavior. Include exact commands,
  relevant output, and screenshots or video when the behavior is visual.
- For lifecycle fixes, evidence must also verify the resulting process or resource
  state—for example, the parent exit code and whether child services or listening
  ports remain after shutdown.
- Unit and integration tests are regression proof, not a substitute for live
  evidence. If required live evidence is missing, submit **COMMENT**, not
  **APPROVE**, and identify the exact production-facing verification still needed.
- Prefer tests that exercise real logic and observable state. Do not reward mocks
  that only prove another mock was called.
- Keep tests focused: one meaningful assertion path per behavior, no duplicated
  coverage of library behavior, and no brittle presentation-only snapshots.
- Follow the test routing in `AGENTS.md`. The mock-LLM, Docker mock-LLM, and
  live LLM-backed E2E suites run after changes reach `main`, not from PR labels.
  If a risky PR needs pre-merge E2E evidence, recommend manually dispatching the
  relevant workflow against the PR branch.
- Never broaden live E2E triggers or secret exposure for convenience.

## Review Context Integrity

Before submitting the review, compare its summary and every finding against the
current PR title, changed-file manifest, linked issues, and acceptance criteria.
If the review describes files, behavior, issues, or release paths that are not in
that context, stop and re-read the PR rather than submitting stale or mismatched
feedback. Do not approve until this final context check passes.

## What Not to Comment On

Do not leave review comments for:

- formatting or minor style that tooling handles;
- optional “nice to have” refactors unrelated to the change;
- praise-only observations—approve instead;
- extra tests for straightforward data/config changes when existing checks cover
  the risk; or
- temporary `.pr/` artifacts, which are cleaned up by repository automation.

When raising a finding, trace the relevant call or data flow far enough to show
the concrete failure mode. Prefer one high-signal comment over several symptoms
of the same ownership problem.

## Communication Style

- Be concise, specific, and friendly.
- Explain the user-visible or architectural consequence.
- Suggest the smallest viable correction.
- Use GitHub suggestion syntax for local fixes.
- If the PR is sound, approve it without manufacturing feedback.
